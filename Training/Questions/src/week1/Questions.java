//        What does the JDK contain?
//            * Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets.
//            It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar),
//            a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed in Java development.

//        What does the JRE contain?
//                * “Java Runtime Environment” and may also be written as “Java RTE.” The Java Runtime Environment provides the minimum
//                requirements for executing a Java application; it consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core classes, and
//                supporting files.

//        What is the purpose of the JVM?
//               * JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both.
//               Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line,
//               hence it is also known as an interpreter.

//         What does the compiler take as input, and produce as output?
//              * compiler (javac) converts the source code into bytecode. Bytecode is a kind of average machine language. This bytecode file
//              (.class file) can be run on any operating system by using the Java interpreter (java) for that platform. The interpreter is
//              referred to as a Virtual Machine

//         What is a class and how is that different than an object?
//          * A class is a templates that are used to create objects, and to  define objects data types and methods.
//            An object is an instance of a class.
//        EXAMPLE
//            public class Dog {
//                String breed;
//                int age;
//                String color;
//
//                void barking(){
//
//                }
//
//                void hungry(){
//
//                }
//
//                void sleeping(){
//
//                }
//            }
//
//        Where are objects stored in memory?
//              * Heap memory

//        Variables declared inside a method are stored where?
//               * Stack memory
//
//        Describe the stack and heap
//              * STACK is a linear data structure which stores a collection of objects.
//              * HEAP is the area in memory which is used to store objects.
//
//              * STRING POOL is a storage area in heap where string literals stores.

//        When is an object eligible for garbage collection?
//              * An object is eligible for garbage collection when there are no more references
//              to that object.

//        What types of constructors are there?
//        What is a default constructor?
//                If you define a constructor in a class, is the default constructor still provided?
//                What is Git?
//        Explain the difference between Git v. Github?
//                What commands are associated with the typical Git workflow?
//        What does git add do?
//        What does git commit do?
//        What 2 types of variables are there?
//                What is the difference between the two types?
//                What is casting?
//        Is narrowing casting implicit or explicit?
//        Is widening casting implicit or explicit?
//        What arithmetic operators exist in Java? What is the % operator?
//                What is a ternary operator?
//        What is the difference between postfix and prefix (++x, x++, --x, x--)?
//        What does it mean for a logical operator to "short-circuit"?
//                Describe binary operator numeric promotion
//        What data-types does a switch statement support?
//        While v. do-while loop?
//                What is the syntax for a for loop?
//                What are some properties of an array?
//        Is it slower to access an array's elements if the array has a huge number of elements compared to a small array?
//        What are a few ways to create an array?
//                What 4 variable scopes are there?
//        What is the purpose of the static keyword?
//        If a field is static, what does that mean? How do we access a static field?
//        If a field is non-static, how do we access a non-static field?
//        What 4 access modifiers are there? What is their order from most restrictive to least?
//                What is encapsulation? Why do we use getters/setters?
